# Show courses

A simple list of courses fetched from local data source

## Created a courses.json file in assets

Using the HttpClient component to fetch data.

## Installed a datatable component

npm i -S angular2-datatable

It will show some data but dosent play well with bootstrap 4, could downgrade to 3.3.7 and continue from there.

## Found links afterward and may continue down this road later if no complete datagrid show up in the near future.
